# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction App

A smart, easy-to-use web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on basic medical inputs. This app is powered by a machine learning model trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and built with an intuitive UI using **Streamlit**.

## 📌 About the Project

This project aims to make early-stage diabetes prediction accessible through a web interface. Users simply input a few health-related values, and the model instantly predicts the diabetes outcome.

This project was developed using:

- ✅ **Streamlit** – for the web UI  
- 🐍 **Python** – core programming language  
- 📦 **Anaconda + Spyder** – for scripting, testing, and environment management  
- 📊 **scikit-learn** – for model training and prediction

## 🔢 Features & Inputs

The model uses the following features for prediction:

- Number of Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin Level  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

✔️ Real-time prediction  
✔️ Clean and responsive interface  
✔️ Easy to deploy or extend
