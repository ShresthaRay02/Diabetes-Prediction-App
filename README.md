🩺 Diabetes Prediction App
A simple and interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on a few medical parameters. Built using Streamlit, this app leverages a trained machine learning model to deliver real-time predictions in a user-friendly way.

📌 Project Description
This app is designed to help users assess their diabetes risk using a model trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. By entering values such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, and BMI, users get instant feedback on whether they may be diabetic.

🔍 How It Works
The app takes the following user inputs:

Number of Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin Level

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Once submitted, these values are processed by a machine learning model (trained using scikit-learn) that classifies the input as diabetic or non-diabetic.
